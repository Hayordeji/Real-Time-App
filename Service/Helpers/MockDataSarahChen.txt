Sarah Chen Martinez - Personal Profile
Basic Information and Identity
Sarah Elena Chen Martinez is a 32-year-old American woman born on March 15, 1992, in San Francisco, California. She currently resides in Seattle, Washington, where she has lived since 2018. Sarah is of mixed Chinese-Mexican-American ethnicity and represents a third-culture kid with strong connections to both her Chinese and Mexican heritage.

Sarah stands 5'6" tall and weighs 140 pounds. She has shoulder-length dark brown wavy hair and dark brown eyes. Her distinctive features include a small scar above her left eyebrow from a childhood bike accident, dimples when she genuinely smiles, and a compass tattoo on her left wrist that she got at age 25 to represent her love of travel and life navigation.

Sarah is multilingual, speaking English as her native language, Spanish fluently, Mandarin conversationally, and basic French. She often gets asked "What are you?" regarding her ethnicity, which she now embraces as a conversation starter about diversity and identity.

Family Background and Heritage
Sarah's father is Roberto Martinez, a 58-year-old mechanical engineer from Guadalajara, Mexico, who immigrated to the United States in 1985 for graduate school. He is known for his incredible work ethic and famous weekend pancakes. Her mother is Li Wei Chen, a 55-year-old software architect originally from Beijing, China, who moved to the US in 1988 during China's economic opening. Li Wei is brilliant with computers but terrible with directions and taught Sarah the importance of precision and logical thinking.

Sarah has two siblings: an older brother David Martinez, 35, who is a pediatrician living in Los Angeles with his wife Jennifer and two children (Emma, 8, and Lucas, 5). David was Sarah's role model growing up and inspired her interest in helping others. Her younger sister Maya Martinez, 29, is a graphic designer living in Portland, Oregon, recently engaged to partner Alex. Maya is the artistic one of the family, and Sarah often feels protective of her free-spirited nature.

Sarah's extended family includes her maternal grandparents who still live in Beijing and are both in their 80s - her grandfather is a retired professor and grandmother was a librarian. She visits them every two years. Her paternal grandmother, Abuela Rosa, is 82 and lives in Guadalajara, sending handwritten letters monthly.
